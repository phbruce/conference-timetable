# Conference Timetable [![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/a99a88d28ad37a79dbf6/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/codeclimate/codeclimate/maintainability)

Conference timetable is an experiment using [Genetic Algorithm (GA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) to build schedules for confereces. It was built with [Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load) for I/O data to translate the informations.

## How to test

```bash
# bash
ruby bin/mount_conference_timetable.rb
```

Work on progress
